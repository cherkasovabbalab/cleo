R data analysis script (in Markdown) for manuscript entitled The Effects of Sensory Feedback on Simulated Online Slot Machine Gambling by Cherkasova, Assi, Craw, Riffey, Ferrari & Clark. The data for the script are at https://osf.io/8nh5p. Either the .Rdata file can be loaded into the environment, or the raw data can be used (less recommended given the amount of data and file size). For multilevel model diagnostics, .rds files within this repo can be read in.
